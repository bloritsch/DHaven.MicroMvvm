# DHaven.MicroMvvm
A very simple ViewModel first MVVM infrastructure that works equally well with WPF (requires MahApps.Metro) and UWP apps.
Does not require a container or component framework, and does not prevent using one either.

A key feature is the `IWindowManager` to open new windows, display notifications, show dialogs.  The API is consistent for both UWP and WPF applications so you can hit the ground running with an API that is familiar.
